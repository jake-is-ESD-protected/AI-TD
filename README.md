# AI-TD
***Transient designer with analog circuitry, digital control and AI assisted enhancement!***

## About
AI-TD is a unique approach to transient shaping. This project utilizes the **Daisy Seed** by **Electrosmith** as a powerful embedded system for audio within a guitar pedal. On command it samples the user's instrument signal and estimates a suggested transient shaping by employing an **embedded AI**
