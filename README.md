## About
AI-TD is a unique approach to transient shaping. This project utilizes the **Daisy Seed** by **Electrosmith** as a powerful embedded system for audio within a guitar pedal. On command it samples the user's instrument signal and estimates a suggested transient shaping by employing an **embedded AI**. These estimations are obtained from multiple opinions from a variety of professional guitar players sourced directly from Germany's cultural melting pot **Berlin**.

|Platform:|**Daisy Seed by Electrosmith**|
|Chipset:|**STM32H7 family**|
|AI:|**Driven by X-CUBE-AI (STM)**|
|AI-Model:|**Selfmade, see [*empty link*]()**|
|Effect:|**Transient shaping**|

## Motivation
While transient shaping might not be a complex operation in neither the analog nor digital domain, utilizing it well as an effect definitely is. Tuning such an effect is often a mystery to beginners and it is even dependent on playing style. This means that you'd have to dial in your transient shaper from scratch every time you change your playing style during a jam. With **AI-TD** you just have to hold down the stomp button, play a lick in your intended playing style for a few seconds, release and let an AI give you a transient shaper best suited for you!
